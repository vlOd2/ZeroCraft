ZeroCraft contains numerous improvements and new features over the original server

ZEROCRAFT IS CURRENTLY NOT VERY OPTIMIZED AND REQUIRES A LOT OF MEMORY FOR LARGE OPERATIONS

# 📌 Features & Upcoming Features
- Plugin system (Upcoming as current system is very bad)
- Console command system
- Console variable system
- Various generation options
- Support for most classic clients
- CPE support (Upcoming)
- Various optimizations (Upcoming as the server has been made only to work currently, the code is not very optimized)
- Up to 128 players (Tested, needs atleast 1GB of ram on a 128x256x128 world, this will be updated when "Various optimizations" are implemented)
- Message customization (Most important chat messages can be customized in "message.yml")
